<h3>Little Women(2019)</h3>
<p>The 2019 adaptation of the book is so beautiful and it's such a heartfelt, warm and sweet movie. Celebrating family and friends and the joy of womanhood. 
    How each women is different from other in what they want and what they get and it's just left an impression on my heart and will forever inspire me to become a
    writer like Jo :D <br />
